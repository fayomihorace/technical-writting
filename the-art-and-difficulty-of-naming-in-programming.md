# The art and difficulty of naming in programming

**Important note**: *Do not read any of the comments in the thread without solving the challenge*.


This article is a follow of my very first article 
**[Every programmer should know these conventions and practices](https://dev.to/fayomihorace/every-programmer-should-know-these-conventions-and-practices-8j6)**.

So in this article, I'll develop a little more in-depth the point: **Give meaningful names**.

Giving a meaningful name to our variables, functions, arguments, classes, attributes, and packages is both *difficult* and an *art*. Sometimes, and even often, every developer who cares about code quality stumbles upon naming issues. Personally, I can spend a lot of time just thinking about what will the best name for this, and I can choose one, change it later, multiple times until I find one or a colleague helps me to find the one that satisfied me the most, the one that makes me say or think, *yeah, that is the perfect name*.
Because, the name could drastically change how easily other developers and you (later, in a few years maybe ^_^) will quickly understand your code without necessary reading the details.
