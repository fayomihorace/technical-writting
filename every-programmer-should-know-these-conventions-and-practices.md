Without rules and standards, we would be living in total chaos, and if every programmer had the freedom to do or write whatever he wanted as code, we would probably still be in the time where computers could occupy an entire apartment 😁.

But fortunately, this is not the case 😌. There are rules and standards every programmer should know. If you didn’t know these standards, don’t worry, I was a bad programmer too, a very bad one, but now I’m better and I’m still improving. Now, if you already knew them I congratulate you. But read anyway until the end for peace of mind.

I won’t really detail or give examples to these rules, as each of them requires at least a whole article with a lot of real cases examples, exceptions, or edge cases. I’ll just list them and cover each of them alone in its own article.
